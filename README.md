# ListingFilesToTxt
Better not to .txt but to .doc, though. This program lists files matching certain conditions which are contained in a selected directory.
You must specify the target directory and the otput file by full addresses (because what I have on my computer is just for me).
You can also specify the file size trashhold, extensions and some initial messages.
